	<h2>Hi and welcome to my page</h2>
	<p>
		 My name is James Cadden i'm 29 years old and i was born in Swindon but now live in Andover. The reason i have
		made this site is to show what are the best things that describe me. Below you will find the two main things in my life that make me well me.

	The biggest thing that makes me me is my family, I have my wife Rachel, who i have been together with for 9 years and married to for 3 years. We 
	have two amazing children Travis who is 7 and Bella who is 1 and also a scottish Terrier Nessie.<br>
	My wife Rachel is a health care assistant in Winchester A&E. She has been working there for the last 6 years. She is my rock in everything I do and she supports me no matter what.
	Travis is currently in year 3. He loves rugby and swimming, which he does every weekend.
	Bella is my little Razmanian Devil who causes destruction wherever she goes. My walls have the artwork on then to prove it.<br>

	The biggest hobby of mine is my motorbikes. I love everything about them and can forget to stop talking about them at times. I passed my test in July 2016
	and since then i have had:

	My wife loves riding on my bikes with me.We travel out as much as we can in the summer for days out. Every year I do the reading toy run, which is a charity
	event with around 500-600 bikes and pillions. We all dress up in christmas ourfits and ride through reading to a Bernardos School where we all give a gift to help 
	children in difficult situations. Every year I attend motorbike rallys with my friends, where we get to appreciate bikes, talk about bikes and ride bikes.
	My current motorbike is a 2000 Suzuki Bandit 1200, which is a custom design with double the horsepower it came out of the factory with so its not for the faint at heart.
